## Loading the reuired libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)
library(caTools)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Loading the dataset
```{r}
df <- read.csv("D:/Data Projects/Practice Files/Student Performance/Student_Performance.csv")
```

## Exploring the dataset
```{r}
summary(df)
```
## Building the model
```{r}

split <- sample.split(df$Performance.Index, SplitRatio = 0.8)
split
```
```{r}
## dividing into training and testing sets
training = subset(df, split == TRUE)
testing = subset(df, split == FALSE)
```


```{r}
## designing  and implementing the model

model <- lm(Performance.Index~., data = training)

summary(model)
```
## Conlcusion: The model has an accuracy score of 98%, making it an accurate predictor of the student performance
```
